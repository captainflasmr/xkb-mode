* Summary

A Major mode for editing X Keyboard Extension (XKB) files

xkb-mode is an Emacs major mode designed to facilitate the editing of XKB files, providing syntax highlighting and other useful editing features tailored specifically for XKB file format. Whether you're customizing keyboard layouts or diving into the details of X Keyboard Extension configurations, xkb-mode aims to make the task more efficient and enjoyable.

** Whats New
  Version 0.2.0

  - Correct version from 0.6.0 to 0.2.0 to reflect the actual stage of
    development.
  - Remove the 'Alternatives' section, streamlining the introduction.
  - Improve code formatting for better readability and maintenance. This
    includes more consistent use of newlines and arrangement of font lock
    faces.
  - Use `#'` prefix for function symbols as a best practice, explicitly
    marking `xkb-indent-line` as a function, enhancing code clarity.
