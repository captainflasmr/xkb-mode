* Features

- Syntax highlighting for XKB-specific keywords, modifiers, and structures.
- Custom indentation logic for XKB code blocks.
- Auto-detection of .xkb files to automatically enable the mode.

* Alternatives

As far as I can tell this is the first Emacs minor mode supporting the xkb format.

* Installation

To install xkb-mode, you can use the following method:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/captainflasmr/xkb-mode.git
#+end_src

2. Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/xkb-mode/directory")
(require 'xkb-mode)
#+end_src

Replace "/path/to/xkb-mode/directory" with the actual path to where you've cloned or downloaded xkb-mode.

* Usage

Opening any .xkb file with Emacs should automatically enable xkb-mode, providing you with syntax highlighting and indentation support for editing XKB files.

Currently, xkb-mode provides a basic set of features optimized for general usage. Future versions may include customizable options based on user feedback.
